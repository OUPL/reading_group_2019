QBS paper: [A Convenient Category for Higher-Order Probability Theory](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.02547.pdf).

#### Possible POPL19 papers (in no particular order):

* [An Abstract Domain for Certifying Neural Networks](https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3290354)
    * Abstract interpretation of neural networks.

* [A Separation Logic for Concurrent Randomized Programs](https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3290377)
    * Based on / extends the idea of coupling.


#### Possible AAAI-19 papers:

* [Capacity Control of ReLU Neural Networks by Basis-path Norm](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2019/AAAI-ZhengS.1575.pdf)
    * "Basis-path Norm" as a capacity measure for ReLU networks. Generalization error bound based on the norm. It "explains the generalization behaviors of ReLU networks more accurately than previous capacity measures".

* [Inverse Abstraction of Neural Networks Using Symbolic Interpolation](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2019/AAAI-DathathriS.3732.pdf)
    * Computing symbolic abstractions of pre-images of unsafe outputs under a network (regions in input space mapped to the unsafe output by the network).

* [Robustness Guarantees for Bayesian Inference with Gaussian Processes](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2019/AAAI-CardelliL.5988.pdf)
    * Robustness (against adversarial examples) measure for Bayesian inference. 

* [Distributionally Adversarial Attack](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2019/AAAI-ZhengTianhang.602.pdf)
    * Solving for optimal "adversarial-data distribution", a square-norm constrained deviation from the original distribution that maximally increases generalization risk. 


##### Less relevant but maybe interesting (also AAAI-19):

* [Compiling Bayesian Network Classifiers into Decision Graphs](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2019/AAAI-ShihA.4035.pdf)
    * Decision graphs are small thus amenable to tractable formal verification.

* [Sparse Adversarial Perturbations for Videos](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2019/AAAI-WeiX.2649.pdf)
    * Computing adversarial perturbations for key frames in a video and interpolating across the frames in between. Sparse means "temporally sparse".
    
#### Possible Other Papers

* [Compiling Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for probabilistic modeling](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~jgm/papers/pldi17.pdf)
    * PLDI'17 (Did we already read this paper?)
