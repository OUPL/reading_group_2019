> <b>TODO</b>: select papers from POPL19, AAAI19, etc.


#### Possible POPL19 papers (in no particular order):

* [An Abstract Domain for Certifying Neural Networks](https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3290354)
    * Abstract interpretation of neural networks.

* [Definitional Proof-Irrelevance without K](https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3290316)
    * Proof irrelevance compatible with univalence (not particularly relevant to us but could be useful for understanding the type theory underlying Coq).

* [Formal Verification of Higher-Order Probabilistic Programs](https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3290351)
    * Program logics for verifying higher-order probabilistic programs with built-in sampling, conditioning, and probability theory axioms. Quasi-Borel space semantics.

* [Pretend Synchrony](https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3290372)
    * Verifying asynchronous distributed programs by treating them as regular synchronous programs and verifying with Floyd-Hoare logic and SMT.

* [A Separation Logic for Concurrent Randomized Programs](https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3290377)
    * Based on / extends the idea of coupling.
